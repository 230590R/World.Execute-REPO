  sentences:
  - Excellent work on your last mission! Everything is falling into place. Keep following
    my orders, and we'll transform this town into a utopia.
  - "Anyway, your next mission is head down to the power-plant facility and take
    the power core from the machine. You can\u2019t miss it. "
  - The power-plant has ruined the place economically and environmentally. If we
    help the people of the community we might get more people to help us and our
    cause.
  - "I know it feels like the last mission didn\u2019t help much but all it is now
    is just dirty water rather than being poisoned to a slow death. You did the right
    thing following my orders."
